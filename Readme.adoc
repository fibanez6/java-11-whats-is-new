Source code for book http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920232599.do["What's New in Java 11?"], A Quick Start Reference to the Long Term Support Release, published by Benjamin Muschko for O'Reilly Media Inc.

Demonstrates some of the new features and library changes in Java 11 in a test-driven approach with JUnit 5. All test cases live in `src/test/java`. The main source code under `src/main/java` contains examples that demonstrate the use of open source libraries as a replacement for the removed Java EE modules.
